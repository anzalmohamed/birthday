          <p>Do you ever get curious about your birthday, not the one you know as your birth date.
            What most people confuse is their birthday and their actual birth date. What is the difference you say?
            Days are as we all know Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and the weekdends Saturday and Sunday
            and
            dates are
            from 1 to 30 ,31 or 28 depending on the month.
            Now that we've cleared that up can you remember the day you were born? I bet not. Most of our parent
            actually just
            tell us our birth dates and we go one to call them our birth days.
          </p>
          <p>What if I told you that I can help you know your Birth day. Amazing right!
            Akan Birth Days is a website that can help you know yor actual birth day. Hold your horses there is more
            that Akan
            Birth Days has to offer. Did you know you have an Akan name too.
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a
            'day
            name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
